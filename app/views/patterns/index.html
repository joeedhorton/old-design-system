        <p class="govuk-body-l">Patterns are guidance on how to solve certain types of problem. They include examples of successful approaches but are flexible and don&rsquo;t prescribe exact design solutions.</p>
        <p>These patterns extend those used across Government in the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/">GOV.UK design system</a>. As our patterns mature, we will look to contribute them to the GOV.UK system so they can be used more widely.</p>
