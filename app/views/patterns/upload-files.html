        <li>to add single files</li>
        <li>to add multiple files</li>
        <li>for a range of file types</li>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">It should not be used:</h3>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>in some internal services where there is a need for bulk uploading</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">The Add file pattern should:</h3>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>replay the file details clearly to reduce user error</li>
        <li>show the progress of an upload so users know that something is happening</li>
        <li>allow the user to skip the process if it is optional</li>
