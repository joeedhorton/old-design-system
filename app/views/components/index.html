        <p class="govuk-body-l">Components are ready-made interface elements that can be used in  different patterns and layouts. They are part of our visual language and are intended to be used unchanged for a consistent user experience.</p>
        <p>These components extend those used across Government in the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/">GOV.UK design system</a>. As our components mature, we will look to contribute them to the GOV.UK system so they can be used more widely.</p>
