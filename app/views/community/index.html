      <p>This design system is for everyone. Its purpose is to extend the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Design System</a> with work specific to the Home Office.</p>
      <p>Patterns or components that have a wider use will be contributed to the GOV.UK Design System so they can be used by delivery teams across government.</p>

      <p>Find out more in this section about how you can contribute ideas and get involved with the Home Office design system. </p>
