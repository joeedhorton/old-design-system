      <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Proving a pattern or component works</h1>
      <p>The working group review new contributions. They may decide that something else meets the need better. If the working group agree that a pattern or component is needed, it will move through the following stages:</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Experimental</h2>
      <p>We've seen this problem in an area and it's being peer reviewed by the team and iterated upon. It may change a lot in Experimental. Teams are free to use it in their own prototypes. Please report back any research findings. It should not be used in production.</p>
      <p>Components and patterns in Experimental will be regularly reviewed by the working group.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Recommended</h2>
      <p>We've seen this pattern or component work consistently in testing and are recommending its use. There will also be evidence of user research to support this.</p>
      <p>If you've found a user need and this pattern or component meets it, use this version. On occasion we may recommend a pattern or component due to the need for consistency.</p>
