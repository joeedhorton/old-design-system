# Contributing to the Home Office Design System

This design system is for everyone. Its purpose is to extend the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) with work specific to the Home Office. Patterns or components that have a wider use will be contributed to the GOV.UK Design System so they can be used by delivery teams across government.

## How to contribute

The Design System has an open [backlog](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/design-system/projects/1). Anyone can propose, develop or contribute to new patterns and components, or improvements to existing ones. 

Follow 3 steps to propose a component or pattern for the Design System.

### 1. Share the work
Talk about the pattern or component to the community. Share your work, as other teams might be working on the same thing. Gather feedback and examples from the community.

### 2. Check the backlog
Check if the pattern or component is already on the backlog. If it is, feel free to comment and post screenshots of your example. Tell the Design System team if you want to contribute to it.

### 3. Raise a new issue
If your idea is not on the backlog, raise an issue. A member of the Design System team will get in touch to discuss your proposal.

When raising an issue, explain why you think it should be included in the design system. You can also include screenshots and research notes.
